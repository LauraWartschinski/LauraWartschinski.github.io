<p>I am a computer science student at Humboldt University, Berlin. I am very interested in security topics, especially how to write secure software and avoid vulnerabilities in applications, and I am looking for opportunities to learn more and gain experience.
</p>


<h2>studies</h2>

<p>Some of my courses during my master's were network security, protocols and algorithms of internet communication, cryptology, security and privacy in distributed systems, safe and secure software systems, peer-to-peer systems, and machine learning. I did a projects on tunneling IP over DNS and security mechanisms in KNX.<br>
My master's thesis is titled Detecting Software Vulnerabilities with Deep Learning. I scraped a large number of commits fixing vulnerabilities in python code from Github and trained Long Short Term Memory networks to recognize some typical patterns of e.g. sql injection or xss vulnerabilities. The source code and data are available on <a href="https://github.com/LauraWartschinski/VulnerabilityDetection">github</a>, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/LauraWartschinski/VulnerabilityDetection/blob/master/Master%20Thesis/master.pdf">thesis</a> itself.
</p>

<h2>work experience</h2>
<p>While studying, I participated in the <a href="https://portal.effra.eu/project/1436">PREVIEW</a> project for wireless sensor networks in industrial facilities, mainly doing software development in C++ and Go. I was also a working student helping with teaching in theoretical computer science for several semesters. <br>
From August 2018 to August 2019, I worked as an intern in the department of Cyber Security for the Detecon <a href="https://www.detecon.com/en/consulting/consulting-practices/innovation-special-assets/digital-engineering-center">Digital Engineering Center</a>. My tasks included various demonstrations (e.g. keylogger, mimikatz, Rubber Ducky), the creation of a comprehensive risk assessment framework, and explaining web security concepts in workshops and lectures. <!--You can downlad my full CV <a href="">here</a>.-->
</p>

<h2>interests</h2>

<p>I am very interested in both how to design secure software, and how to find vulnerabilities and exploit them. Currently, I am teaching myself some more by doing online CTF and hacking challenges. I like listening to podcasts like Darknet Diaries and Soft Skills Engineering.<br>
Besides that, I co-founded the local <a href="http://shbh-gbs.de/">secular humanist student's association</a> with a focus on humanism, rationality, a scientific worldview and open-minded thinking. I also volunteer for <a href="http://saram-nk.org/">Saram</a>, an organization for human rights in North Korea. I also love pen&amp;paper roleplaying, hiking, and music festivals.
